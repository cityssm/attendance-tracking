# Employee Attendance

![Absence Requests](images/attendanceAbsences.png)

MonTY provides four tools to help track details associated with attendance variances.
Each tool can be disabled if it is not needed, and users can have varying permissions
within each tool.

Note that MonTY isn't meant to replace a payroll system that will ultimately determine
how an employee is compensated during an attendance variance.
It was developed with the following in mind.

- Give after hours watchpersons an organized way to record the employee calls
  they receive, without requiring access to the payroll system
  and without the use of easy to misplace sticky notes.

- Notify supervisors of employees that will not be showing up for
  their scheduled shifts.

- Provide managers with reporting options to identify habitual absences,
  and other attendance related issues.

## Absence Requests

Absence requests track last minute absence calls from an employee.
They can be used to record sick calls prior to a shift.
